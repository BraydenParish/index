# llm-debate
Get two LLMs to debate each other in a seamless manner. Would also be interested in having more than 2 LLMs debate each other almost like a roundtable debate. Could also maybe even look into simulating a podcast of 3 LLMs (Using something like NotebookLLM) and have them argue with voice.
